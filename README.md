This is an essay about the ellipse and the calculation of the elliptical arc, by
considering the fact that an ellipse is always a circle projection. We will use
Python and C for the calculations and AutoCAD for the drawings. I am not making
any claims here about finding something new, as I saw many similar approaches
on the net when I was writing that essay.
